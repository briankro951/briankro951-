          Brian Morones is a classically trained percussionist and composer, 
          but has recently been invested in the sounds of electronic music 
          and synthesis using virtual, digital, and analogue synthesizers 
          and effects. Still having a love for his acoustic and orchestral 
          background, Brian now tries to build a bridge between the two worlds 
          to create programmatic music and soundscapes. 
       </p>
       <p>He hopes these compositions can create and/or inspire stories 
            of their own, stories that can take place in a different world. 
       </p>
       <p>
          Brian is currently a first-year MFA student at CalArts. He received 
          his BA in Music Theory and Composition at the University of California, 
          Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2019 under the College of Creative Studies music 
          program (CCS).
