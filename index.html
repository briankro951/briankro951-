        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        <p>I'm an aspiring composer hoping to 
          making it into the film world as either 
          a composer or sound designer, but 
          hopfully primarily as musician.</p>
        <p>My education in music started while I was in elementary, 
            but I never recieved the resources to be properly prepared 
            for more advanced education even by the time I graduated Highschool, 
            so I mainly started my real education when I attended the University 
            of California, Santa Barbara. There I sharpened my basic skills 
            needed as a musician, and learned beyond. I played in the UCSB 
            Percussion Ensemble all four years I attended there, learned to 
            orchestrat for acoustic orchestral instruments, and learned to produce 
            electronic music with digital-audio-work stations, as well as using 
            hardware syntheresizer to use for my performances, 
            solos and acompanied.</p>
        <p>In the final year of my undergrade at UCSB, 
            I was fortunate enough (and purely from coisidence) 
            to have encoutnered a film crew in need of a sound operator. 
            I was inexperienced, but determined to learn. I didn't even 
            think of it as a gateway to the film world, I simply wanted 
            to apply my production passion to the film world in some way. 
            For the crew, and many more in the near future, I have helped with on 
            field recording, as well as post production.</p>
