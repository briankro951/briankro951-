        <h2>
            About Me ::
        </h2>
        <p> Brian Morones is a classically trained percussionist and composer, but has recently been invested in the sounds of electronic music and synthesis using virtual, digital, and analogue synthesizers and effects. Still having a love for his acoustic
            and orchestral background, Brian now tries to build a bridge between the two worlds to create programmatic music and soundscapes.</p>
        <p>He hopes these compositions can create and/or inspire stories of their own, stories that can take place in a different world.</p>
        <p>Brian is currently a first-year MFA student at CalArts. He received his BA in Music Theory and Composition at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2019 under the College of Creative Studies music program (CCS).</p>
